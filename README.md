# puppet-storm

Wirbelsturm-compatible [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/) module to deploy [Storm](http://storm.incubator.apache.org/)
0.9+ clusters.

You can use this Puppet module to deploy Storm to physical and virtual machines, for instance via your existing
internal or cloud-based Puppet infrastructure and via a tool such as [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) for local
and remote deployments.

# Quick start

See section [Usage](#usage) below.


<a name="features"></a>

# Features

* Supports Storm 0.9+, i.e. the latest stable release version.
* Only supports Netty as Storm's messaging backend, which is the default backend since Storm 0.9.  Support for the
  legacy ZeroMQ backend was deliberately removed from this module.
* Decouples code (Puppet manifests) from configuration data ([Hiera](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/hiera/1/)) through the
  use of Puppet parameterized classes, i.e. class parameters.  Hence you should use Hiera to control how Storm is
  deployed and to which machines.
* Supports RHEL OS family (e.g. RHEL 6, CentOS 6, Amazon Linux).
    * Code contributions to support additional OS families are welcome!
* Storm is run under process supervision via [supervisord](http://www.supervisord.org/) version 3.0+.


<a name="requirements"></a>

# Requirements and assumptions

* A Storm cluster requires a **ZooKeeper quorum** (1, 3, 5, or more ZooKeeper instances) for proper functioning.  Take a
  look at [puppet-zookeeper](https://github.com/miguno/puppet-zookeeper) to deploy such a ZooKeeper quorum for use with
  Storm.
* This module requires that the target machines to which you are deploying Storm have **yum repositories configured**
  for pulling the Storm package (i.e. RPM).
    * We provide [wirbelsturm-rpm-storm](https://github.com/miguno/wirbelsturm-rpm-storm) so that you can conveniently
      build such an RPM yourself.
    * Because we run Storm via supervisord through [puppet-supervisor](https://github.com/miguno/puppet-supervisor), the
      supervisord RPM must be available, too.  See [puppet-supervisor](https://github.com/miguno/puppet-supervisor)
      for details.
* This module requires that the target machines have a **Java JRE/JDK installed** (e.g. via a separate Puppet module
  such as [puppetlabs-java](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-java)).  You may also want to make sure that the
  Java package is installed _before_ Storm to prevent startup problems.
    * Because different teams may have different approaches to install "base" packages such as Java, this module does
      intentionally not puppet-require Java directly.
    * Note: Based on our own experience we strongly discourage the use of OpenJDK 6.  We run into many weird errors
      with it.  If you need Java 6 use Oracle/Sun Java 6.
* This module requires the following **additional Puppet modules**:

    * [puppet-supervisor](https://github.com/miguno/puppet-supervisor)

  It is recommended that you add these modules to your Puppet setup via
  [librarian-puppet](https://github.com/rodjek/librarian-puppet).  See the `Puppetfile` snippet in section
  _Installation_ below for a starting example.
* **When using Vagrant**: Depending on your Vagrant box (image) you may need to manually configure/disable firewall
  settings -- otherwise machines may not be able to talk to each other.  One option to manage firewall settings is via
  [puppetlabs-firewall](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-firewall).


<a name="installation"></a>

# Installation

It is recommended to use [librarian-puppet](https://github.com/rodjek/librarian-puppet) to add this module to your
Puppet setup.

Add the following lines to your `Puppetfile`:

```
# Add the puppet-storm module
mod 'storm',
  :git => 'https://github.com/miguno/puppet-storm.git'

# Add the puppet-supervisor module dependency
mod 'supervisor',
  :git => 'https://github.com/miguno/puppet-supervisor.git'
```

Then use librarian-puppet to install (or update) the Puppet modules.


<a name="configuration"></a>

# Configuration

* See [init.pp](manifests/init.pp) for the list of currently supported configuration parameters.  These should be
  self-explanatory.
* See [params.pp](manifests/params.pp) for the default values of those configuration parameters.

### Using Hiera

A "full" single-node example that includes the deployment of [supervisord](http://www.supervisord.org/) via
[puppet-supervisor](https://github.com/miguno/puppet-supervisor) and
[ZooKeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org/) via [puppet-zookeeper](https://github.com/miguno/puppet-zookeeper).
Here, both ZooKeeper and Storm (Nimbus, Supervisor, UI) are running on the same machine called `stormsingle1`.
That's a nice setup for your local development laptop or CI server, for instance.

```yaml
---
classes:
  - storm::nimbus
  - storm::supervisor
  - storm::ui
  - supervisor
  - zookeeper::service

# Custom Storm settings
storm::zookeeper_servers:
  - 'stormsingle1'
storm::nimbus_host: 'stormsingle1'
storm::nimbus_childopts:     '-Xmx256m -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true'
storm::ui_childopts:         '-Xmx256m -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true'
storm::supervisor_childopts: '-Xmx256m -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true'
storm::worker_childopts:     '-Xmx256m -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true'
storm::supervisor_slots_ports:
  - 6700
  - 6701

## Custom supervisord settings (note: this is supervisord, not Storm's Supervisor daemon)
supervisor::logfile_maxbytes: '20MB'
supervisor::logfile_backups: 5

## Custom ZooKeeper settings
zookeeper::autopurge_snap_retain_count: 3
zookeeper::max_client_connections: 500
```

Of course you can (and normally will) use multiple Storm nodes.  Here, you will typically run Storm Nimbus and Storm UI
on the "master" machine, and a Storm Supervisor daemon on each of the "slave" machines in the Storm cluster.  Also, you
will typically have a dedicated ZooKeeper quorum.  Note that in small deployments you can alternatively also opt to use
only a single ZooKeeper instance, which is co-located with the Storm Nimbus/UI daemons on the same master machine.

Storm master node example, assuming the master node is called `nimbus1` and the ZooKeeper server is called `zookeeper1`:

```yaml
---
classes:
  - storm::nimbus
  - storm::ui
  - supervisor

## Custom Storm settings
storm::zookeeper_servers:
  - 'zookeeper1'
storm::nimbus_host: 'nimbus1'
storm::nimbus_childopts:     '-Xmx1024m -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true'
storm::ui_childopts:         '-Xmx512m  -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true'

## Custom supervisord settings (note: this is supervisord, not Storm's Supervisor daemon)
supervisor::logfile_maxbytes: '20MB'
supervisor::logfile_backups: 5
```

Storm slave node example:

```yaml
---
classes:
  - storm::supervisor
  - supervisor

## Custom Storm settings
storm::zookeeper_servers:
  - 'zookeeper1'
storm::nimbus_host: 'nimbus1'
storm::supervisor_childopts: '-Xmx256m  -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true'
storm::worker_childopts:     '-Xmx1024m -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true'
storm::supervisor_slots_ports:
  - 6700
  - 6701
  - 6702
  - 6703

## Custom supervisord settings (note: this is supervisord, not Storm's Supervisor daemon)
supervisor::logfile_maxbytes: '20MB'
supervisor::logfile_backups: 5
```


<a name="manifests"></a>

### Using Puppet manifests

_Note: It is recommended to use Hiera to control deployments instead of using this module in your Puppet manifests_
_directly._

TBD


<a name="service-management"></a>

## Service management

To manually start, stop, restart, or check the status of the Storm daemons, respectively:

    $ sudo supervisorctl [start|stop|restart|status] [storm-nimbus|storm-supervisor|storm-ui]

Example:

    $ sudo supervisorctl status
    storm-nimbus                     RUNNING    pid 7491, uptime 0:05:12
    storm-ui                         RUNNING    pid 7421, uptime 0:05:26
    storm-supervisor                 RUNNING    pid 7507, uptime 0:05:03
