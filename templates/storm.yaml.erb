  # Due to a Puppet/rspec-puppet bug we unfortunately cannot put the hash-to-YAML-fragment conversion into a custom
  # Puppet function under lib/puppet/parser/functions/, and unit test that function in isolation.  The problem is that
  # as soon as we create a lib/ folder running rspec-puppet via e.g. `rake test` will fail, complaining about not
  # finding e.g. `validate_absolute_path` of puppetlabs/stdlib.  It looks as if this bug only affects Puppet 3.0.x.
